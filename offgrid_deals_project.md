# Off-Grid Discounts - Project Planning & Strategy

## Project Overview
Building a modern affiliate deals website called "Off-Grid Discounts" targeting off-grid living enthusiasts in Canada through a 150k member Facebook group.

## Key Audience Insights ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT
- **Target:** Canadian off-grid living Facebook group (150k members)
- **Challenge:** Right-wing, anti-corporate, anti-Amazon sentiment
- **Resistance:** Distrust of big corporations, government, traditional marketing
- **What Works:** Essential infrastructure items only
- **Proven Converters:** Solar lights, power generators, battery banks, diesel stoves

## Technical Stack Decision
- **Frontend:** React (user is comfortable with this stack)
- **Data Source:** Google Sheets API for deal curation
- **Hosting:** Static deployment (Vercel/Netlify for speed)
- **Update Strategy:** Nightly rebuilds (meets Amazon ToS requirements)

## Site Structure
- **Volume:** ~100 deals total
- **Loading:** Infinite scroll (20-25 initial, 15-20 per load)
- **Layout:** Magazine-style grid, mobile-first
- **Categories:** Focus on power/energy solutions primarily

## Affiliate Strategy - DUAL APPROACH üéØ
**Key Innovation:** Price comparison between retailers to build trust

### Affiliate Programs
1. **Amazon Associates** (complex API, universal availability)
2. **Rakuten/Cabela's** (better brand fit, developer account ready, simpler API)

### Comparison Card Strategy

```

### Why This Works
- Transparency builds trust with skeptical audience
- Users choose their preferred retailer
- Positions you as helpful price-checker, not pushy affiliate
- Double commission opportunities
- Addresses anti-Amazon sentiment while still offering choice

## Google Sheets Structure
```
Product Name | Image URL | Amazon Price | Cabela's Price | Amazon Link | Cabela's Link | Deal End Date | Category | Featured
```

## Conversion Psychology for This Audience
- **Avoid:** Corporate marketing speak, flashy design, "SAVE NOW" urgency
- **Use:** Practical specs, honest comparisons, outdoor aesthetic
- **Messaging:** "I check both so you don't have to" / "Your choice - save money or support outdoor retailers"
- **Design:** Think REI meets deal aggregator - authentic, trustworthy, rugged
